# RustAdminBans

## Better Battlemetrics Bans to Discord
This bot gives you the ability to send different types of Battlemetrics ban information to select Discord channels over a web hook. This “bot” does not require a physical bot to be in any Discord, it’s solely operated through web hooks.

This bot uses the Battlemetrics bans API to send newly added bans to Discord through a staff and public embed format. It uses Battlemetrics server IDs to separate each type of ban and where it goes. It also allows you to send specific server bans to specific Discord communities for example.

## Below is a complete setup guide and a showcase:
